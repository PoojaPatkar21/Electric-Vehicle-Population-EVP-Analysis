## Key Activities: 
1.	Comprehending the dataset.
2.	Performed data cleaning to ensure accuracy and consistency.
3.	Generated business questions to guide data-driven decision-making.
4.	Conducted data analysis using Excel and SQL to uncover insights.
5.	Developed interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize key findings effectively.

## Features
1.	KPI Cards ‚Äì Track key EV metrics such as total electric vehicles, EV types, brands, electric range, base MSRP, cities, Legislative districts. 
2.	Interactive Visuals ‚Äì Various charts to analyze trends in EV adoption across regions and time.
3.	Custom Measures ‚Äì DAX-based calculations for deep insights into EV population and market penetration.
4.	Data-Driven Decision Making ‚Äì Helps in understanding EV adoption patterns, regional distribution, and brand demand.


## Data Cleaning
‚≠ê The eoriginl dataset contains null values. I have performed data cleaning by removing the null values.

## Analysis using SQL 
‚≠ê Convert the csv file to excel format 

Steps to Import Data from Excel to SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS):

1.	Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and connect to your database.
2.	Create a new database named as ‚ÄúEVPDB‚Äù
3.	Navigate to Tasks > Import Data in Object Explorer.
4.	Select Microsoft Excel as the data source and browse for your Excel file. Click the 'Browse' button to select the path to the Excel file you want to import. Choose the correct Excel version and click Next. Tick the 'First Row has headers' checkbox if your Excel file contains headers. Click Next.
5.	On the 'Choose a Destination' screen, select destination database: Select Server name as "Microsoft Excel OLE DB Provider for SQL Server".
6.	On the 'Specify Table Copy or Query' window: For simplicity just select 'Copy data from one or more tables or views', click Next.
7.	Complete the import process and verify the data using 
   USE EVPDB; 
   SELECT * FROM dbo.EVP
